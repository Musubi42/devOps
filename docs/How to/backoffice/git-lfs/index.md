# Hï»¿ow to store large file with Git

**Git LFS (Large File Storage)** is an extension to Git that helps developers efficiently manage large binary files like images, videos, and datasets. Instead of storing these files directly in the Git repository, Git LFS replaces them with pointers, reducing repository size and improving performance. It seamlessly integrates with Git, making it easy to work with large files while preserving the core benefits of version control.
